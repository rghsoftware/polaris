# Polaris ⭐

> An ADHD-friendly task manager that works with your brain, not against it.

Polaris transforms project management from a source of anxiety into a supportive external brain that celebrates neurodivergent strengths while providing essential executive function scaffolding.

## 🎯 Philosophy

**ADHD users don't need to be fixed; they need tools that work with their brains.**

Polaris is designed around core principles:
- **Reduce cognitive load** - Minimize decisions at every step
- **Minimize decision fatigue** - Smart defaults and natural language input
- **Provide immediate feedback** - Real-time updates and confirmations
- **Celebrate small wins** - Gamification and positive reinforcement
- **Support, not shame** - No guilt, no pressure, just progress

## ✨ Key Features

### Quick Capture
- **Zero-friction task entry** - Single field, natural language processing
- **Immediate local save** - Never lose a thought
- **Background enhancement** - AI adds structure without blocking you

### ADHD-Optimized Task Flow
```
INBOX (no decisions required)
  ↓
TRIAGE (when executive function available)
  ↓
ACTIVE / BLOCKED / SOMEDAY
  ↓
DONE (celebrate! 🎉)
  ↓
ARCHIVED (automatic after 30 days)
```

### Focus Sessions
- **Pomodoro timer** with customizable intervals
- **Hyperfocus tracking** - Learn your productivity patterns
- **Gentle break reminders** - Prevent burnout
- **Session analytics** - Understand when you work best

### Task Intelligence
- **Cognitive load scoring** (1-10 mental effort scale)
- **AI task decomposition** - Break overwhelming tasks into manageable steps
- **Estimated vs. actual time** - Reality-check your time perception
- **Dopamine score prediction** - Prioritize rewarding tasks

### Public Dogfooding
- Share your progress publicly
- Daily coding streaks
- Focus time metrics
- Accountability through transparency

## 🛠 Tech Stack
